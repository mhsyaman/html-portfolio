<h1>About Me</h1>
<!-- <hr /> -->
<p>
  Hello, my name is Muhammad Syaman, but you can call me Syaman. I aspire to
  become a full stack web developer. I have a fundamental understanding of both
  front-end and back-end development. However, my knowledge so far is limited to
  the basics. Therefore, I am starting from scratch to ensure I fully grasp web
  development and cover any gaps in my learning.
